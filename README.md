# AI Curriculum Builder

A modern web application that helps users design customized learning journeys for AI and machine learning topics.

## Project Structure

This project is designed with a clear separation between frontend and backend:

### Frontend
The frontend is a React application built with:
- TypeScript
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn-ui components
- Framer Motion for animations

The frontend allows users to:
- Select learning topics, pace, and style preferences
- Generate personalized curriculum plans
- Track progress through the learning plan
- Mark lessons as complete
- View information in a beautiful and intuitive UI

### Backend (Coming Soon)
The backend will be implemented separately and will include:
- API endpoints for curriculum generation
- User authentication and profiles
- Progress tracking
- Content management

## Getting Started
